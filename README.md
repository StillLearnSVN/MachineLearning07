# IT Del Student Log In-Log Out Analysis with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict IT Del student log in-log out behavior using machine learning techniques. The goal is to leverage log data to perform classification and prediction tasks, focusing on the time gaps between log in and log out events. This project is a part of the Machine Learning course, and it provides hands-on experience with the end-to-end machine learning workflow: from data preprocessing to model implementation and evaluation.

## Objectives
- To implement machine learning methods to classify and predict patterns in student login behavior.
- To explore and utilize various machine learning models for both classification and regression.
- To fine-tune models and achieve optimized performance for predictive accuracy and classification reliability.

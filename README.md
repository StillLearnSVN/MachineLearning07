# Business Opportunity Prediction using IB(Izin Bermalam),IK(Izin Keluar), KM(Keluar Masuk) Base On Students Historical Data

## Project Overview
This project aims to identifying patterns in students' overnight stay permissions (IB) and exit permissions (IK) using clustering algorithms to support strategic decision-making, uncover business opportunities based on student needs, and ensure the effective processing of permission data to generate relevant insights. The project aims to cluster student permission patterns, utilize clustering algorithms to identify potential business opportunities, and develop a data-driven analytical model to improve campus services and facilities.

## Objectives
- To implement clustering algorithms (K-Means and Affinity Propagation) to identify patterns in students' overnight stay (IB) and exit permissions (IK).
- To analyze permission data to uncover insights that support strategic decision-making for campus services and operations.
- To explore potential business opportunities based on patterns detected in students' permission behaviors.
- To develop a data-driven model that improves campus facilities and services by understanding students' needs.
- To validate and evaluate the clustering model using metrics such as Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Score, and Davies-Bouldin Index for optimal performance.
